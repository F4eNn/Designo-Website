- This project includes a 7-page site. 
  - That allowed me train my organize skills, folder structure and so on...
  - Now I know that keeping section features in one place is better option than structure which I applied in my project


## Your users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The `Name`, `Email Address` or `Your Message` fields are empty should show "Can't be empty"
- View actual locations on the locations page maps
